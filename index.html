    <h1>Cilfero Records Archetype Sort 1</h1>
    <p>Recording/s of 2025, Feb 18th, 1:50 AM, Labelling of -.1 -> -.3</p>
    <h2>Label -.1</h2>
    <p>The flowers that freeze upon winter are kept from being bloomed, blossoming flowers can only happen during their right environment, but some flower stand out, blooming during the cold, in one of nature's worst climates for growing. The coldness that surrounds these flowers can be seen as a flaw of nature, but these flowers fight on their own without the need of external help and bloom at their worst. When the frozen climate dissipates, the flower has already grown used to the coldness, some adapt, most seem to also dissipate with the negative environment. The intentions of the flowers are never quite understandable, either to grow negativity within the negativity, or to grow within the negativity. A phenomenon that pique's my interest within the social construct of our society,   but it does not exemplify real life events, it only is a mean of a metaphor, a worded representation of colorful words...</p>
    <h3>Label -.2</h3>
    <p>If time was frozen, all concepts in a pause, droplets in rainy weather kept at a stand still, and the busy noises within a big city gone quiet, but only one person left to continue their existence in this stand by. Any thing, concept, moment, warmth, coldness, feelings, objects, they come in contact with is unpaused till they let go, how long would it take for them to face the harshness of this situation, the evergoing immortality that keeps them in this form of purgatory, death, pain, concepts of negativity cannot be felt, but any forms of positivity cannot be felt either. Would they still be the same after ten years, a hundred years, a thousand years, tens of thousands of years, hundred thousands of years, millions, billions, trillions, as long as existence could exist, would they truly be the same? </p>
    <h4>Label -.3</h4>
    <p>Don't you ever have those moments, where the loosely glued jar gets over filled with problems, and you relieve those problems by slowly letting bits out to a wall with no reply, and you hope that the "wall" will one day be the same "wall" you dreamt of, over and over, talking to different walls hoping for a reply, or even a reaction, but yet the recurring outcome is nothing, and the loosely glued jar gets overfilled, with cracks appearing every now and then, with you picking up the pieces consciously, and putting them back, gluing them in a rush so you can focus on the oncoming future, and you realize your control in this situation, the easiest of it, being you, breaking that jar yourself.</p>
