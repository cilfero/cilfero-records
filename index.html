    <h1>Recording/s of 2025, Feb 18th, 1:50 AM, Labelling of -.1 -> -.3</h1>

    <h2>Label -.1</h2>
    <p>The flowers that freeze upon winter are kept from being bloomed, blossoming flowers can only happen during their right environment, but some flowers stand out, blooming during the cold, in one of nature's worst climates for growing. The coldness that surrounds these flowers can be seen as a flaw of nature, but these flowers fight on their own without the need for external help and bloom at their worst. When the frozen climate dissipates, the flower has already grown used to the coldness, some adapt, most seem to also dissipate with the negative environment. The intentions of the flowers are never quite understandable, either to grow negativity within the negativity, or to grow within the negativity. A phenomenon that piques my interest within the social construct of our society, but it does not exemplify real-life events, it only is a means of a metaphor, a worded representation of colorful words...</p>

    <h2>Label -.2</h2>
    <p>If time was frozen, all concepts in a pause, droplets in rainy weather kept at a standstill, and the busy noises within a big city gone quiet, but only one person left to continue their existence in this stand-by. Anything, concept, moment, warmth, coldness, feelings, objects, they come in contact with is unpaused till they let go, how long would it take for them to face the harshness of this situation, the ever-going immortality that keeps them in this form of purgatory, death, pain, concepts of negativity cannot be felt, but any forms of positivity cannot be felt either. Would they still be the same after ten years, a hundred years, a thousand years, tens of thousands of years, hundred thousands of years, millions, billions, trillions, as long as existence could exist, would they truly be the same?</p>

    <h2>Label -.3</h2>
    <p>Don't you ever have those moments, where the loosely glued jar gets overfilled with problems, and you relieve those problems by slowly letting bits out to a wall with no reply, and you hope that the "wall" will one day be the same "wall" you dreamt of, over and over, talking to different walls hoping for a reply, or even a reaction, but yet the recurring outcome is nothing, and the loosely glued jar gets overfilled, with cracks appearing every now and then, with you picking up the pieces consciously, and putting them back, gluing them in a rush so you can focus on the oncoming future, and you realize your control in this situation, the easiest of it, being you, breaking that jar yourself.</p>

    <h1>Recording/s of 2025, Feb 18th, 2:14 AM, Labelling of -.4 -> -.5</h1>
    <h2>Label -.4</h2>
    <p>Records of history are only written down by the victors of war, but the true story will always alter from what is said in history, the lies that blind the unblinded. Their teeth sinking into those who seek to uncover deeper territories of falseness, the unaltered truth kept in records deep below. But as humanity evolves, the past becomes pointless, only serving as a warning on what not to do in future altercations or situations. It only ever continues to grow, like stems from a branch, branches from a tree, trees from a forest, forests from a region, regions from a country, countries from continents, continents from planets, planets that fill up space, space filled with lights that we call stars, the all correlate from one to another. Yet we cannot evolve faster than time allows us to, we will only derive from others, and future others will derive from us too.</p>

    <h2>Label -.5</h2>
    <p>The bloodied hands of those who commit sin can be washed, but those stained in scars cannot be cleansed, the scars that are placed upon a persons back had come from others, but they will never see the damage done upon them, it is only when another brings up the scars of the past. Scars are not only made by others, but can be made from themselves, if placed in an environment filled with negativity, subjects are prone to self harm, or a much worse self inflicted fate. The subjects that had already commited self harm that survived seemt to understand the pain of commiting self harm, some continue to do so, and others fear that same burning sensation. </p>
    
    <h1>Recording/s of 2025, Feb 19th, 2:14 AM, Labelling of -.6 -> -.7</h1>  
    <h2>Label -.6</h2>
    <p>Concepts taught to those lower than those concepts are a common necessity to understanding the true nature of these concepts, giving the taught one the ability to be on par with those concepts, but taught ones are limited to not be similar to those concepts, only to understand them. The unfiltered taught ones are much different, either becoming those concepts or deriving from those very concepts into newer concepts of life. Subjects who are put into a similar experiment have proven this hypothesis true, they have become one with the concept they were exposed to, allowing control of that very same concept while collecting several subjects consciousness into a same hivemind within that concept. </p>

    <h2>Label -.7</h2>
    <p>The difference of abilities of those born to inherit such things as the stars, or those born to suffer is no different, the only difference is where they start from. Mentioned in Label -.5, the subjectee who were in a stronger position was no different than the one in a lower tier of position, the only difference in this experiment was the location of their scars, identifying who was higher on the tier. The higher tiered subjects had scars placed all over their fronts, while the lower tiered had scars set in their backs, the experiment shows how the lower tiered subjectees ran and most likely got injured while running. Interesting...</p>
